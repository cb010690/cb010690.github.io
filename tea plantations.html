              <h3>1. Pedro Tea Estate</h3>
              <p>Sitting in the shadow of the lush greenery of Pidurutalagala, 3km east of Nuwara Eliya, Pedro Tea Estate was established on the very spot that James Taylor planted his first tea bushes and kick-started the Ceylon tea industry. Established in 1885, the factory was under British ownership until it was nationalised in 1975, before being reprivatised just a decade later. Despite its plantations and tea fields being less picturesque than others, it is one of the most easily accessible estates in the hill country and the 20-minute long tours take you through the entire manufacturing process, from grading to packaging, where you will see plenty of pieces of colonial-era equipment that is still in operation.</p>
