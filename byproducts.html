      <h3>Herbal Tea</h3>
      <p>These are classified according to the raw material used and the type of manufacture adopted. Orthodox processed
        tea leaves produce “particular” teas like semi-fermented oolongs and reprocessed, scented and compressed teas.
        Delicately plucked and processed teas make numerous “prominent” teas. The raw material is taken from the plants
        which are well grown in an excellent habitat with advantageous ecological conditions and are made skillfully and
        exquisitely with delicate flush buds and leaves of the tea plants belonging to fine varieties. Herbal teas are
        made by processing veritable teas together with medicinal herbs, which are used to complement the curative
        properties of the former for many ailments.</p>

        <h3>Tea Seed Oil</h3>
        <p>Tea seeds are used as a source of supplementary protein and edible oil for human consumption, apart from many
          other industrial applications. The prospects of tea seed oil are immense. It can be a substitute for any
          edible oil; it can also be used as a cheaper alternative to olive oil which is mostly imported. Cosmetic
          industry may use it for manufacturing hair lotion, soap, etc.
          The thiosaponin has some medicinal value. It acts as an adjuvant, anti-inflammatory agent.</p>
