        Ceylon Tea carries behind it a heritage and success story like no other. A product that began as a diversification experiment in 1867 spanning just 19 acres of land has today surpassed all geographical borders to satisfy 19% of global demand. Reputed for its signature taste and aroma, Sri Lanka has become the world's third largest tea exporter to the world, the country's largest employer and has the distinction of supplying tea to the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. It is a great equalizer, demanding attention from the counter of the smallest eatery to the most exclusive tea-bars in the world.

       <p id="paragraph"> James Taylor arrived in Ceylon in 1852, settling down at the Loolecondera Estate, Galaha.
        He begins a 19-acre tea plantation on the Loolecondera Estate in 1867, laying the foundation for what would become Sri Lanka’s largest export industry for over a century.
        In 1872, a fully equipped tea factory began operating on the Loolecondera Estate.
        In 1873, Ceylon Tea made its international debut when twenty-three pounds of tea produced by James Taylor reached London.
